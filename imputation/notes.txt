imputation

1. missing data problem
2. imputation strategy
- get some individuals with complete data
- split them into 2N individual haplotypes
- get individuals with missing data
- split them into haplotypes
- match the incomplete segments in target to complete segments in the reference
- creates a mosaic of chromosomes from surrogate parents

3. perform imputation
first get the data
- download reference data
- get genotype data
- remove bad snps
- flip so that all snps are on forward strand
- update positions to match the reference
- may need to update snp ids also
- phase the snp data and perform imputation
	- ask class to use different parameters
		phasing ne
		phasing iterations
		phasing states
		phasing window
		imputation ne
		imputation haplotypes
		imputation k_hap
- look at output formats
- look at quality metrics
	concordance table
	distribution of info scores
	distribution of allele frequencies
	relationship between info score and allele frequency

4. look at influence of imputation on GWAS results
- upload to locus zoom to generate plots
- fine mapping

5. meta analysis
- summarise Evangelos Evangelou1 and John P. A. Ioannidis2,3
